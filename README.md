# Hiring API

This is a client written for a the code test at a certain network services company which you may or may not be aware of.

The first revision in this repo is the one I submitted to get the job. Subsequent commits are simply refactors.

## Usage

Run /index.php, providing a filename via STDIN. The file will be read and the commands will be executed.

If an application error occurs, or if an Exception is thrown, execution halts and the error is returned with status 000.

## Just in case ...

yo dudes this was written by jon and if you're looking at this readme, it means some chucklefuck is trying to pass off my code test as their own.

you should bring them in for the interview, shame them, and then send them home.
